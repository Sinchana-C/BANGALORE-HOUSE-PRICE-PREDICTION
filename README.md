# BANGALORE-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION

    The real estate sector is an important industry with many stakeholders ranging from regulatory bodies to private companies and investors. Among these stakeholders, there is a high demand for a better understanding of the industry operational mechanism and driving factors. This project can be considered as a further step towards more evidence-based decision making for the benefit of these stakeholders. By conducting explanatory data analysis, we obtain a better understanding of our data. This yields insights that can be helpful later when building a model, as well as insights that are independently interesting.
    Many sub steps are taken to get, clean and transform the data. The process presented is used that have been chosen according to their similarities in terms of presentation of the estates and if they give the same information about them. Using Machine learning techniques, we are then able to identify a subset of the original features that are in a sense sufficient to describe our data.
