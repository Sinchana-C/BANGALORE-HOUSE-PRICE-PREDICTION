# BANGALORE-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION


   The aim of this project is to predict the sale price of the houses in Bangalore. Input variables are area_type, availability, location, size, society, total_sqrt, bath, balcony. And the output variable is price. We are dealing with only the location, total_sqrt, bath and size. The Machine Learning part is about trying to find the best learning algorithm for a given problem even if it is highly conditioned by how well the data has been processed and tune some parameters to improve it.
   
   The real estate sector is an important industry with many stakeholders ranging from regulatory bodies to private companies and investors. Among these stakeholders, there is a high demand for a better understanding of the industry operational mechanism and driving factors. This project can be considered as a further step towards more evidence-based decision making for the benefit of these stakeholders. By conducting explanatory data analysis, we obtain a better understanding of our data. This yields insights that can be helpful later when building a model, as well as insights that are independently interesting.
